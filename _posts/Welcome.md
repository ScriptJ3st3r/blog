# Introduction
Welcome to my cyber security journey, this blog is basically a way for me to catalogue and "store" my findings. I am basically a novice who is at least decent in programming and likes learning(But I hate universities even though I have a bachelor's degree). 
I would try to keep a consistent weekly schedule of unknown days because the university I am in is no respector of time at all
